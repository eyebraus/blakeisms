            <h3>Anthony Blake: Our Supreme Commander</h3>
            <h4>(??? - Heat Death of the Universe)</h4>
            <div class="eight columns offset-by-two about-text-container">
                <p>Anthony "Cxaxukluth" Blake (iä iä) was birthed of primordial star-slime in aeons long forgotten. He has since shifted furtively through the now-collapsed minds of mere mortals, feeding upon their dreams until nothing but nightmares remain.</p>

                <p>In 1968 he released <em>Seven Shimmering Eyes of Cat-man-doo</em>, a seminal recording in the then-booming jazz fusion movement. After a string of Number 1 singles, the band suddenly fell apart due to Anthony's harrowing addiction to importing novelty Kit-Kat bars from Japan.</p>

                <p>Anthony soon cleaned up his act and opened a chain of successful lava lamp emporiums. In 2033 he decided to publish his memoirs: this site contains a select few nuggets of his wisdom.</p>
